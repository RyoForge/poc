# ðŸš€ Welcome to New React Project!

Kickstart your React development journey with ease! This project is built with the powerful [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for a seamless experience.

## ðŸ”§ Essential Scripts

In your project directory, you'll find several commands to help you manage and develop your application efficiently:

### `npm start`

Launch your app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

- The app auto-reloads as you make changes.
- Check the console for any lint errors.

### `npm test`

Run tests in interactive watch mode.\
Learn more about testing in the [official guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Prepare your app for production.\
Creates an optimized build in the `build` folder.

- Minified code for best performance.
- Filenames include hashes for efficient caching.

Your app is now ready for deployment! Read more about it [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Caution: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If the default setup doesn't meet your needs, you can `eject` to gain full control over the configuration. This command copies all the configuration files and dependencies into your project, allowing customization. Use this feature only if you need it.
